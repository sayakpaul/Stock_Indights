# Stock_Insights
Python script to do some analytics. The main goal here is to acquire the data and structure it for use. I didn't do anything fancy for the labeling part. 
I used the YAHOO-INDEX_GSPC dataset for comparing part and labeling mostly. And the rest of the data for the companies was acquired from https://pythonprogramming.net/downloads/intraQuarter.zip/
